/* telepathy - EDITORIAL
* This question, as the name suggests, requires you to have telepathy with
* either yourself or another player.

* Essentially, you have to keep "topping up" your score
* above the previous score attained (not the score you entered in the
* program's code) by either you * or another
* submitter such that it slowly reaches 100.

* Notes:
- You aren't allowed to submit a value >= 50.
- You have to input each value exactly to 2 decimal places.

* Example (How I AC'd this problem)
* Remember that these are the scores attained by the submitter, not the
* scores that they wanted to get (in the program code).

* Submitter (S) | ATTAINED: 22    | ENTERED: UNKNOWN
* Me (M)        | ATTAINED: 60.88 | ENTERED: 38.88
* Me (M)        | ATTAINED: 100   | ENTERED: 39.12
